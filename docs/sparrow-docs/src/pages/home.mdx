# Why *Sparrow*?

It's not an acronym â€“ it's just nice to name software artifacts after real
things. The name *Sparrow* is meant to evoke the spirit of this tool: sparrows
are small, common birds that come in many different types. They tend to blend
into their environment and are well-adapted to the presence of humans.

The *Sparrow* software tool is designed for light weight and ease of management,
while allowing labs to maintain control of data and process. Each lab's version
of *Sparrow* will have its own characteristics, but the implementations will look
similar to outsiders.
