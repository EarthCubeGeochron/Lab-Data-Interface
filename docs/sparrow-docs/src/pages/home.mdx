Best practices for data accessibility and archiving are a key concern within the
geochronology community. Meanwhile, evolving time-integrated digital Earth
models must be referenced against robust, global age datasets. Increasingly,
laboratory data must be accessible to a broad mosaic of data repositories and
consumers; systems are needed to manage these integrations and automate data
archiving.

## A component of an integrated data infrastructure

The **Sparrow** software provides a standard access layer for measurements
produced by individual geochronology laboratories. The system can be deployed
atop current, lab- specific systems and workflows for data collection,
reduction, and storage. The application programming interface (API) provided by
Sparrow can be accessed by end users and centralized archives.

## A easy-to-deploy web presence for geochemical laboratories

Sparrow includes
an extensible, web-based management overlay that streamlines laboratory metadata
management tasks such as controlling data embargo, identifying and linking geologic
and publication metadata, and generating aggregate summaries. The software
straightforwardly implements FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,
reusable) data management principles [5] for host labs. **Sparrow** is open-source
software that is built to be lightweight, flexible, and standards-compliant.

# Why *Sparrow*?

It's not an acronym â€“ the name *Sparrow* is meant to evoke the spirit of this
tool: sparrows are small, familiar birds that come in many different types. They
tend to blend into their environment and are well-adapted to the presence of
humans.

The *Sparrow* software tool is designed for light weight and ease of management,
while allowing labs to maintain control of data and process. Each lab's version
of *Sparrow* will have its own characteristics, but the implementations will look
similar to outsiders.
