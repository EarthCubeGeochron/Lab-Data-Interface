Although Sparrow is a complex software application, it is packaged in
a set of [**Docker** containers](https://www.docker.com/), enabling relatively seamless cross-platform
installation, independent of the configuration of the base system.
Local installation is possible, but less supported.

:::note
Running Sparrow on Windows is somewhat more complex than for Unix (e.g. Linux, Mac)
systems. If you want to do this, please see the [**Sparrow on Windows**](/docs/sparrow-on-windows)
documentation.
:::

## Installing Docker

In its containerized form, Sparrow can be installed easily
on any Unix environment. This containerized
distribution strategy will allow easy deployment on any infrastructure
(local, cloud hosting, AWS/Azure, etc.).
The Docker toolchain is stable and open-source.

The only installation requirements on Unix host
systems (e.g. Linux and MacOS) are `docker` and `python3`.
First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and
`docker-compose` using the instructions for your platform, and
make sure your user can run `docker` without root permissions (typically
`sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}`).
Installation is also possible on Windows 10 using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Getting the code

Currently, all installations of Sparrow require you to fetch the source code
from GitHub. Work is progressing on a "standalone" version of Sparrow that does not require
interacting with the source code. But for now, only development installation
is supported.

```
git clone https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow.git
cd Sparrow
```

## Installing the command-line interface

**Sparrow** is administered using the `sparrow` command-line
interface. This command wraps application management, database management,
and container-orchestration subcommands (wrapping [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/))
in a single executable, simplifying basic management tasks.
Lab-specific subcommands (e.g. for import scripts) can be included in this
interface.

To install the command-line application, run the setup command within the
`Sparrow` repository directory:

```
make install
```

This will build a development version of the
`sparrow` command-line runner.

:::caution
`make install` requests **`sudo`** privilege elevation so that it can
install `sparrow` to `/usr/local/bin`, which allows the command to be
run without a path prefix on most systems. If you want to install to a different location, you can
instead run `SPARROW_INSTALL_DIR=<root-path> make install`. This will install `sparrow`
to `<root-path>/bin/sparrow`.

## Running Sparrow

Typing `sparrow` at the command line will download and build containers
(this will take a long time on initial run)
and show the [application's help page](/docs/cli).
Seeing the help page successfully means the application has been installed.

The **Sparrow** application can be run using the command
`sparrow up`. The environment variable
`SPARROW_SECRET_KEY` must be set before running, but other variables
will be set to default values if not provided. Thus, a minimal working
**Sparrow** demo can be run using the following command:

```
SPARROW_SECRET_KEY=TemporaryKey sparrow up
```

This command will spin up a database engine, frontend, backend,
and gateway service (details of each service can be found in
`docker-compose.yaml`) and automatically run the `sparrow init`
command to set up database tables.
The **Sparrow** web interface can then be accessed at `http://localhost:5002`;
the API can be found at `http://localhost:5002/api`.

### Creating a user

On navigating to the web interface for the first time, you will not be logged
in â€” indeed, no user will exist! To create a user, run the `sparrow create-user` command and follow the prompts. There should be a single row in
the `user` table after running this command. Note: the `SPARROW_SECRET_KEY`
environment variable is used to encrypt passwords, so make sure
this value is kept consistent through the lifetime of the application.

## Running a configured application

**Sparrow** is configured using a shell script that exports environment
variables to customize the **Sparrow** installation. An example of this script
is shown in [`sparrow-config.sh.example`](). While not _required_ (environment
variables can be set externally), this approach is strongly preferred.

At runtime, the `sparrow` application finds a configuration file by searching
upwards from the current directory until the first file named
`sparrow-config.sh` is found. Alternatively, the location of the configuration
file can be set using the `SPARROW_CONFIG` environment variable. This will
allow the `sparrow` command to be run from anywhere on the system.

The best way to get a basic configured application to test is by running the
`sparrow create-test-lab <your-directory>` command, which will give you a
basic lab with a few plugins and a small test dataset, based on the configuration
[in this directory](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/tree/master/test-lab).

Managing lab implementations of Sparrow as Git repositories is a good idea, as it
allows plugins and site content to be versioned and pinned (using [Git submodules]())
to a specific version of Sparrow. This has the added benefit of allowing configurations
and lab-specific code to be publicly available to guide future implementations. This approach
is taken by the [UW Cosmogenic Nuclide lab](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/sparrow-uw-cosmo),
[Arizona Laserchron Center](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-LaserChron),
[WiscAr](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-WiscAr),
[the Desert Research Institute](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-luminescence-demo),
and other implementing facilities.

### Inspecting the running application

Several `sparrow` subcommands allow inspection of the running
**Sparrow** application:

- `sparrow test` runs the application's testing suite.
- `sparrow psql` allows interaction with the **Sparrow** database
  using the standard `psql` management tool that ships with PostgreSQL.
- `sparrow db-tunnel` exposes the PostgreSQL database engine
  on `localhost` port `54321` (database `sparrow`, user `postgres`).
  This is useful for schema introspection and data management
  using GUI tools such as [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).
- `sparrow shell` runs an iPython shell within the application.
- `sparrow shell <container>` creates a command-line shell within a Docker
  container in the application.
- `sparrow config` prints the API server configuration.
- `sparrow compose config` prints the `docker-compose` configuration
  in use for running the containerized application.
