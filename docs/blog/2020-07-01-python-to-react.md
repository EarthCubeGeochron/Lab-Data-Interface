Inpsiring Story about how a small undergraduate geologist learned to code and slowly but surely became a 
frontend expert

### Bio: Test

I work for the WiscAr lab at the University of Wisconsin Madison. This code was written as part of an effort to collect metadata for samples proccessed in the lab, and upload them to Sparrow. As part of collecting metadata for samples, I searched through the primary literature for samples as well as reached out to P.I's in labs for missing data. I wrote this code to fetch data from an API and from local excell sheets, and to then perform some basic analysis such as finding percentages of samples with data and those without data, etc. I also used python to generate JSON of samples with new data that could be uploaded to an API. When I began writing this code I was an undergraduate Geoscience major and had **_no_** experience in python or any programming language. Now on top of python, I have taught myself React.js (which uses javascript/typescript, JSX and ES6).
