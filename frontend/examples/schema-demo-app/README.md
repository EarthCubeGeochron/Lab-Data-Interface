# External schemas

Externally controlled vocabularies
+ schema definitions

Schema definitions are collections of controlled fields
corresponding to vocabulary terms.

- They should be serializable to JSON-LD, JSON Schema, or Typescript
- The terms within them should be linked
- They should be nestable
  E.g.: heating step -> age spectrum

Input schemas are "open"
Output schemas are "closed"
