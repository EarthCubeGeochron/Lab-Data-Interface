# Sparrow test lab

Welcome to a basic test lab for Sparrow! This "lab" holds two samples originating
with the [WiscAr lab](https://wiscar-sparrow.geoscience.wisc.edu) at University of
Wisconsin. It serves as a demo of the basic structure of the application and in-development
metadata management tools.

You can log into the administration console using the username `Test` and password `Test`.

## Database console

This version of the application comes bundled with [**a database console**](database/)
that gives you access to the underlying PostGIS data store.
