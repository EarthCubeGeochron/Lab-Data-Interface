For serialization/deserialization, several options seem to exist
- [Golden-marshmallows](https://github.com/gchorn/golden-marshmallows)
- [Alchemyjsonschema](https://github.com/podhmo/alchemyjsonschema)

Several well-regarded packages seem to exist to solve specific parts of this problem
in isolation:

- [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [Marshmallow-Sqlalchemy](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow-sqlalchemy)
- [Marshmallow-JSONSchema](https://github.com/fuhrysteve/marshmallow-jsonschema)

These all appear to be pretty good options.
