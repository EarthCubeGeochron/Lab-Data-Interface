## About the project

[**Sparrow**](https://sparrow-data.org) is a small data system for geochronology and geochemical labs. It
attempts to solve two problems at the boundary between labs and the community.
Sparrow provides tools for labs to manage their data and its geological
context. It also provides interfaces to allow third parties (community-level
data archives or Earth models, for instance) to _request_ data directly from the
labs' computer systems. These automated links free the labs to focus on their science
while providing a richer set of information to the community.

## Support

Sparrow is supported by the NSF EarthCube program and driven by contributions from
geochemical lab researchers at a variety of institutions.
